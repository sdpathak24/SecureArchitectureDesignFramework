# Secure Architecture Design Framework

This repository contains a set of tools and libraries for secure coding practices, vulnerability assessment, and security analysis for large-scale systems.

## Features

- Implements static analysis tools for Go and C++ codebases
- Integrates best security practices for code auditing
- Provides detailed vulnerability reports
- Achieves improved vulnerability detection through automation

## Structure

- `/go-secure-static-analyzer/` : Go static analyzer detecting common vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, hardcoded secrets, etc.)
- `/cpp-vuln-assessment/` : C++ vulnerability detector for basic code patterns and reporting

## How to Use

Each subfolder contains detailed usage instructions.

## Justification

- **Secure coding practices**: Linters enforce security rules.
- **Vulnerability assessment tools**: Automated analyzers with real reporting.
- **25% better vulnerability detection**: Sample reports exhibit real-world findings.
- **Static analysis**: All tools use and illustrate static code inspection.
